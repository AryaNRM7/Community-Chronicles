# Community Chronicles

The news app "Community Chronicles" was created to fight the deception of false information. This
advanced platform makes use of a news API and a strong Python fake news detection engine to fully
capitalise on the power of technology

# News Website

The "Community Chronicles" news website is designed to provide users with a
comprehensive and reliable news experience. The website leverages a News API to fetch news articles
from various sources and presents them in a user-friendly interface. The news
display area presents the fetched news articles in a grid-like layout, with each article displayed as a card
containing the article's title, image, description, and a link to the full article


# Fake News Detection Application

The Streamlit application provides a text area for the user to input a news article. When
the user clicks the "Check" button, the application vectorizes the user's input using the fitted vectorizer
and then uses the trained classifier to predict whether the input is a real or fake news article. The result
is then displayed to the user.
